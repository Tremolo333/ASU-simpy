# ASU-simpy
contains random code for the final hpdm097 assignment

generator example - the bravest attempt to reproduce a generator to fulfil assessments requirements

V1.0 simplest model of ASU - stripped down from WS n2, solutions (something that works)                      
V2.0 contains the arrivals generator that generates samples from 3 exponential distributions with means 1.2, 9.5, 3.5 standing for 3 different types of patients        
V2.1 same code but simplified
