# ASU-simpy
The depo contains random code for the final hpdm097 assignment
      
V4.0 contains an ASU model and the answer to the first question (bed capacity needed to achieve an annual target of 90% of patients being admitted to the stroke unit within 4 hours of their arrival at the hospital)

TO DO:
1) Calculate bed utilisation for the second question ( The managers would also like to know if they can achieve 90% performance and maintain a bed utilisation in excess of 70%)
2) Run the model with all means of IAT distributions increased by 10%, monitor the stroke patients to answer the secondary question (he percentage of patients admitted to the stoke unit within 4 hours of arrival, bed occupancy and if more bed capacity is needed. )
3) Implement high quality output analysis techniques (WS6).
4) Wrap the model into a streamlit, add various sliders, run button, whatever else (make it look neat and professional)
5) Produce an exceptional lab report no less than 900 words (<1000), use ChatGPT to help.
