# ASU-simpy
contains random code for the final hpdm097 assignment
      
V3.0 contains working version of patients inter-arrival times generator. there are three generators working simultaneously, each for each type of patients. the most common admitted type is Stroke (which makes sence as it has the shortest IAT), there is a total of 451 entries (which makes sence if you count how many patients there would have been manually, ignoring the distributions. should be around 442), mean queue time 1.91 days (which also makes sence and means that there is room for improvement)
