# ASU-simpy
The depo contains random code for the final hpdm097 assignment
      
V4.0 contains a basic working ASU model as specified in assignment and the answer to the first question (bed capacity needed to achieve an annual target of 90% of patients being admitted to the stroke unit within 4 hours of their arrival at the hospital)

TO DO:
1) Calculate bed utilisation for the second question ( The managers would also like to know if they can achieve 90% performance and maintain a bed utilisation in excess of 70%)

2) (Timur) Implement high quality output analysis techniques (WS6). Take into account the amount of time required for the ASU to reach "plateau" - stable in/outflow of patients, adjust the run length.

3) Wrap the model into the streamlit, add various sliders, run button, whatever else (make it look neat and professional)

4) Run the model with all means of IAT distributions decreased by 10%, monitor the stroke patients to answer the secondary question (he percentage of patients admitted to the stoke unit within 4 hours of arrival, bed occupancy and if more bed capacity is needed. )

5) Produce an exceptional lab report no less than 900 words (<1000), use ChatGPT to help.

Environment:
These simulation use the conda environment 'deploy_st' included in 'environment.yml' and the simulation code included in 'V4.0 ASU.ipynb'
